<p>This is the Flask-experiements website.

<p>You are looking at the base template, inside the %body% block.

<p>This is the profile for {{username}}.  Does Jinja2 support the use of
   many different references to the same variable, in this case
   username={{username}} ?

{% if name == "russ" %}
  <p>Oh, I see that you are the user "russ."  You will have special
     priviledges!
